        Our Marketing Campaigns API lets you create, manage, send, and schedule campaigns.

        Note: In order to send or schedule the campaign, you will be required to provide a subject, sender ID, content (we suggest both html and plain text), and at least one list or segment ID. This information is not required when you create a campaign.
